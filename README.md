# java-graph

*** NOT COMPLETE ***

A package that implements a node-graph structure in Java.

I wanted to mess around with making Java packages/programs with Gradle and thought making a graph would be fun.

Prerequistis:
Gradle version 7.2 (at least thats the version I am using)

Install Gradle on Ubuntu:
sudo snap install gradle

Build:
$ ./gradlew build
